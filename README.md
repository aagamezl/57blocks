To can execute the code with `node index.js`, this will execute several examples.  To run the benchmark use `node benchmarks/index.js`.

The code has unit tests, you can run the tests with `npm run test` and `npm run coverage` (you needs to run `npm install` to install the test and coverage libraries) to show the test coverage. I used [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) JavaScript Coding Style, you can verify this running `npm run lint`.
